# Boardify
Boardify is a creative way to display a user's music taste by generating a custom boarding pass based on their Spotify data. 
It combines userâ€™s Spotify listening patterns with a fun, travel-themed personalization can be shared with others on the platform. 
**Note:** This is a project created for UCLA's COM SCI 35L class taught by Professor Eggert in the Winter 2025 quarter.


## Features
- **Connect to Spotify:** The website is integrated with the Spotify API, allowing for seamless integration.
- **Boarding Passes:** Once connected to Spotify, users can generate personalized passes based on their account.
- **Search Bar:** Users can search for their friend's profiles to learn more about them and their music tastes.
- **Interactive Feed Page:** Allows users to like and comment on others' boarding passes, and supports dynamic updates.
- **QR Codes & Barcodes:** Each pass has a scannable QR code and Spotify barcode, allowing for ease of sharing passes and profiles.
- **Deployed:** We deployed our website to a public domain at the following link: https://boardify-1hwa.onrender.com/
